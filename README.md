Design implementation ideas and front end code.

On this page there should also be a button for individual travelers to get more information about how OLSET can work for them. Perhaps the button reads, "I'm a frequent traveller" or more colloquially, "I'm a road warrior." This button could take a user to a page where they would read more information on how Evernote and OLSET work together.

Additionally, the verbiage "I am a Website/App" would read better to our users if written, "I operate a Website/App."

It seems that users can use OLSET without having an Evernote account linked to their OLSET account. This would be a good place to let our users know that, while they will have a better experience by linking an Evernote account, they can still take advantage of OLSET's customization tools without one.

The OLSET logo link at the top left should take me to this page:

Another not about the page above, when we know that our user is a woman, we should show her a piture of a woman standing in front of an airport window instead of a man.

Here we can see that while I have already filled out my preferences, at the top of the page I am still being asked to fill out my preferences. Perhaps this would be a good place to acknowledge that our users hotel needs will change depending on the type of trip they are taking. Instead of asking our user to set preferences that have already been set, we could remind them of the ease of changing their settings depending on their specific needs.

This nav menu allows our users to "Find Hotels" as well as visit "My Preferences"

This is what the user sees at "Find Hotels":

This is what the user sees at "My Preferences":

These two pages are too similar to warrant moving our user from one page to the other. Here are two options to consider.

####Option 1:
Remove the "My Preferences" link in the drop down nav menu and place an edit preferences link in the bottom left corner of the "Find Hotels" page. The edit preferences link would be placed next to the "save preferences" check box.

####Option 2:
Beautify the "Find Hotels" page with photo of hotels that would be suggested for each individual user based on their travel habits. For example, a user whom we know makes frequent business trips to China and has a taste for fine hotels, might see images like this:
